## Use Case
A bit different approach to see the news based on interest, instead of having mess of all the news on landing page. This way user can focus on specific interest and see all the interest related news. User also have some sort of interaction with app by searching news for specific date (user's birthday)!

## Initial UX

* As an initial visitor I want to land and see what the app is about.

* As an initial visitor I want to be able to add certain article to my favorite list.

* As an initial visitor I want to be able to remove an article from my favorite list.

* As an initial visitor I want to be able to type in my birthday date and see the results based on search.

* As an initial visitor I would like to read the entire article at original source.
